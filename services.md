## Consulting
Based on our deep knowledge of community transit, we can give you a hand with your transit technology needs, no matter where you are in your process. Services include:
* Strategic planning
* Needs assessment
* Research and evaluation
* Procurement support
* Implementation support
* Project management
* Training

## Software Development and Implementation of Technology Tools
We've been pivotal in the development of a range of open technology tools that support small transit. Examples include:
* [RidePilot](https://github.com/camsys/ridepilot "The current active fork of RidePilot"), a lean scheduling and dispatching system designed for a network of small providers.
* [The Clearinghouse](https://github.com/rideconnection/clearinghouse "The demand-responsive transportation clearinghouse"), a proof of concept system to integrate the operations of independent demand-responsive transportation providers.
