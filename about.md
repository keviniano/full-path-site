Since 2000, **Kevin Chambers** has been dedicated to assisting public agencies and nonprofits in assuring that their technology investments effectively serve their organizational mission. From 2010 to 2017 he led technology innovation at [Ride Connection](https://rideconnection.org), a Portland-area industry leader in providing mobility options to older adults and people with disabilities. He graduated magna cum laude from Oregon State University with a degree in Spanish and Latin American Studies.

In work that ranges from software development to project management and strategic planning, Kevin is passionate about bringing his cross-cultural experience and systems thinking to remove barriers that prevent people making effective use of technology.

## Our Values
* We believe that effective transit is essential to healthy and productive communities.
* While it can play a key role in making transit service efficient and attractive to users, technology never solves complex problems. People do that. Community needs should always lead.
