### About Full Path

At Full Path, we believe that effective and equitable transit services are essential to healthy and productive communities. Our mission is to help community transportation providers think about and use technology effectively. We provide transit technology consulting services based on our deep knowledge of the community transit field. Our services are aimed at reducing risk, maximizing the investment of public resources, and expanding the capacity of agencies to provide transportation options to the public. Recent projects include developing a simple scheduling tool using Google App Scripts, assessing technology use at small transit agencies, writing a white paper on making technology decisions, forming an advisory group that guided the creation of data standards that will increase equity in transit, creating training curriculum and assessment tools, and blogging and podcasting about technology, mobility management, and other topics.
